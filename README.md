We use science to find your perfect match!

CATalist is the first service within the online pet adoption to use a scientific approach to matching highly compatible cats and hoomans. Catalist's matching is based on using our proprietary AI to match cats and humans based on features of compatibility found in thousands of successful adoptions.
